        <p class="para">The forces of Maharana Pratap, the ruler of Mewar, and the Mughal army led by Man Singh, the general of Emperor Akbar, fought at the Battle of Haldighati. The Mughal Empire’s expansionist policies, which sought to establish control over all of India and subdue any resistance to their rule, are the root cause of the conflict.

            The Mughals saw Mewar as a key target because of its rich cultural and economic heritage. In the years leading up to the battle, the Mughals repeatedly demanded that Maharana Pratap submit to their rule and pay tribute. However, Maharana Pratap cited his belief in Mewar’s independence and honor as the reason he refused to submit to the Mughals.</p>

        <h3>&#8680;Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para">Maharana Pratap was a mythical figure in Indian history who was admired for his bravery, resolve, and independence. As the ruler of the Mewar kingdom, he opposed the Mughal Empire’s efforts to subjugate Rajput states and conquer them. India and its people continue to be profoundly influenced by Maharana Pratap’s legacy.
